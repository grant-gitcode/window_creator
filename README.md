# window_creator
A Chrome Extension for taking disparate existing tabs and forming a new window.

Use Ctrl+Shift+Y to select a tab. You can select multiple tabs. If you select the same tab twice, you will unselect it.

Use Alt+Shift+V to open the selected tabs in a new window, deleting the tabs in the old window.
